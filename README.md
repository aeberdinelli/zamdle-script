# Blur stuff 🤷🏼‍♂️
So like I told you on Discord, you would need to update the blur position/size manually until someone comes up with a better way.

## Running it
- Install ffmpeg (if you are in mac, you can just `brew install ffmpeg`)
- Give the script permissions: `chmod +x blurrer.sh`
- Just run it: `./blurrer.sh`
